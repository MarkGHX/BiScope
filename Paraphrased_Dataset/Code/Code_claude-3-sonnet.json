The function name has been changed from `mean_absolute_deviation` to `calculate_mean_absolute_deviation` to make it more descriptive and self-explanatory.\n2. The parameter name `numbers` has been changed to `values` to better represent the fact that the function can work with any list of numerical values, not just numbers.\n3. The variable name `mean` has been changed to `average` to align with more common terminology.\n4. Instead of using a generator expression inside the `sum` function, a list comprehension `deviations = [abs(value - average) for value in values]` is used to create a separate list of absolute deviations from the mean. This makes the code more readable and easier to understand.\n5. The final calculation `sum(deviations) / len(values)` is performed on the `deviations` list to obtain the mean absolute deviation.\n\nThe enhanced version maintains the same functionality but uses more natural language and follows best practices for code readability and maintainabili",

    "Here's an enhanced version of the sentence with more human-like word choices:\n\nThe provided code defines a Python function named `parse_nested_parens` that takes a string `paren_string` as input and returns a list of integers. The purpose of this function is to analyze the depth of nested parentheses within individual groups of parentheses contained in the input string.\n\nThe function utilizes a nested helper function called `parse_paren_group`, which takes a single group of parentheses as a string and calculates the maximum depth of nested parentheses within that group. It does this by iterating through each character in the group, incrementing a depth counter when an opening parenthesis is encountered, and decrementing it when a closing parenthesis is found. The maximum depth encountered during this traversal is recorded and returned as the result.\n\nThe main `parse_nested_parens` function splits the input string `paren_string` into individual groups of parentheses using the space character as a delimiter. It then applies the `parse_paren_group` helper function to each non-empty group and collects the resulting maximum depths in a list, which is ultimately returned as the output.\n\nThis code can be useful in scenarios where analyzing the nesting structure of parentheses is required, such as in parsing mathematical expressions or evaluating the validity of structured data formats like JSON or XML.",
