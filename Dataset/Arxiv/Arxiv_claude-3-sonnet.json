This paper introduces Fair Mixup, a novel approach to mitigate unfair biases during training by leveraging mixup, a data augmentation technique that interpolates between samples. Fair Mixup constructs interpolations between samples from different demographic groups, effectively creating synthetic samples that smooth the decision boundaries between groups. By training on these synthetic samples, the classifier learns to make predictions that are more equitable across different demographic groups, reducing disparities in outcomes. Fair Mixup operates as a regularizer, encouraging the model to satisfy group fairness constraints without compromising accuracy on the primary task. Extensive experiments on various datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Fair Mixup in improving group fairness metrics while maintaining competitive performance, offering a simple yet powerful technique for fair classification.",

We derive the theorem for both asymptotic and non-asymptotic regimes, providing explicit bounds on the coding rate as a function of the perceptual distortion and the source distribution. The coding theorem enables the design of efficient perceptual coding schemes and has potential applications in various domains, including image and video compression, speech coding, and data compression for machine learning tasks.",

    "Concept bottleneck models aim to learn representations that disentangle high-level conceptual features from raw sensory inputs. These models first map from raw inputs (e.g. images) to an intermediate conceptual embedding space, and then from this embedding space to target outputs (e.g. labels). The conceptual embedding space is intended to capture abstract, human-interpretable concepts that facilitate downstream tasks and enable better generalization. However, it remains an open question whether concept bottleneck models truly learn the intended disentangled representations, or if they exploit other statistical shortcuts during training. This work investigates the learned representations and behaviors of concept bottleneck models to assess whether they align with the original motivations behind these architectures. We explore both synthetic and real-world datasets to characterize the conditions under which concept bottleneck models succeed or fail at learning disentangled conceptual representations.",

    "In this paper, we cast fair machine learning as invariant machine learning. We first formulate the notion of individual fairness as an invariance constraint on the classifier's output: the predicted label should remain invariant to certain transformations of the input that preserve its ground truth label. We then propose a simple yet effective method, Sensitive Set Invariance (SenSeI), to enforce this constraint during training. SenSeI augments the training data with perturbed versions of the input, where the perturbations are designed to capture the notion of fairness under consideration. By encouraging the classifier to produce consistent outputs for the original and perturbed inputs, SenSeI enforces the desired invariance property. Our experimental results on various fairness tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of SenSeI in improving individual fairness while maintaining high accuracy.",

    "Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been successfully applied in various domains, including robotics, gaming, and control systems. However, many real-world RL applications face the challenge of action and observation delays, which can arise due to communication latencies, sensor lags, or computational constraints. These delays can significantly impact the performance of traditional RL algorithms, leading to suboptimal policies or even instability. This paper investigates the problem of RL with random delays, where the actions and observations are subject to time-varying and stochastic delays. We propose a novel RL framework that explicitly models the delay dynamics and incorporates them into the agent's decision-making process. Our approach leverages techniques from delayed reinforcement learning and partially observable Markov decision processes to handle the uncertainty introduced by the random delays.

Despite recent advances, models trained with differential privacy still lag behind their non-private counterparts on datasets like CIFAR-10 and ImageNet. Our analysis shows that this gap arises from two key factors: (1) the limited capacity of existing feature extractors to capture discriminative information under privacy constraints, and (2) the relative scarcity of training data compared to the high-dimensional nature of many learning tasks. We identify a tradeoff between model complexity and the privacy guarantees that can be achieved with a given amount of data. Our findings suggest that either significantly more data or better inductive biases in the form of more powerful privacy-preserving feature extractors are needed to push the boundaries of differentially private learning.",
