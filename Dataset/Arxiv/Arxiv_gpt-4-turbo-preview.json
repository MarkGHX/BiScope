    "In this paper, we propose a novel approach to data poisoning attacks, specifically tailored for deep reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Our method introduces in-distribution triggers into the training data that are indistinguishable from normal inputs by human observers but are designed to maliciously alter the agent's learned behavior. Unlike traditional poisoning or adversarial attacks that often rely on perceptible noise or out-of-distribution examples, our technique subtly manipulates the training process such that the agent behaves normally under regular conditions but exhibits predefined malicious behaviors when the learned triggers are encountered. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in compromising deep RL agents across various environments without impacting their performance on their primary tasks. This paper not only showcases a new vulnerability in deep RL systems but also contributes to the broader discussions on the security of machine learning models against sophisticated data manipulations.",

This process not only conserves the essential information encapsulated by the teacher but also makes it accessible to the student models in a more computationally efficient manner.
